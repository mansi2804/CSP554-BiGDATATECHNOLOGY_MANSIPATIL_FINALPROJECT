The Song/Artist Recommendation System using Spark Streaming aims to enhance user experience on music streaming platforms by providing personalized recommendations in real time. By leveraging Apache Spark, PySpark, PySpark SQL, FindSpark, and MLlib, the system effectively ingests, processes, and analyzes user listening data to identify their preferences and generate tailored recommendations.

Objectives
The project aimed to achieve the following objectives:
•	Enhanced User Experience: Provide personalized song and artist recommendations to improve user satisfaction and engagement.
•	Current Trend Analysis: Identify and present the most popular songs, artists, and trends within the music community.
•	Scalable and Efficient System: Develop a scalable and efficient system capable of handling large datasets.

Design: 
The system employs PySpark and PySpark SQL for data manipulation and Spark for distributed stream processing. Collaborative filtering algorithms from MLlib are used to analyze user preferences and generate personalized recommendations. The technology stack includes Apache Spark, PySpark, PySpark SQL and findspark.
